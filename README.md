Prerequisites:
---
OpenCV > 2.4.x

Usage:
---
1. build the project with Cmake
2. set the internal parameters of the input image (it's ok to use approximate values, for example: pp(cols/2,rows/2), f=1.2*max(cols,rows), but the result will be a little worse)

Performance:
---
40ms on a computer with Intel Core i5-3550p CPU without any optimization and parallel computation in the Release mode.
